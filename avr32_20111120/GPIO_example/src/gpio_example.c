 * \section intro Introduction
 * This is the documentation for the data structures, functions, variables,
 * defines, enums, and typedefs for the GPIO driver.
 *
 * The General Purpose Input/Output manages the I/O pins of the microcontroller. Each I/O line
 * may be dedicated as a general-purpose I/O or be assigned to a function of an embedded peripheral.
 * This assures effective optimization of the pins of a product.
 *
 * The given example covers various use of the GPIO controller and demonstrates
 * different GPIO functionality. It uses a LED and the push button PB0.
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 * - gpio.c: GPIO driver;
 * - gpio.h: GPIO driver header file;
 * - gpio_example.c: GPIO example application.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC for AVR32 and IAR Systems compiler
 * for AVR32. Other compilers may or may not work.
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * All AVR32 devices with a GPIO module can be used. This example has been tested
 * with the following setup:<BR>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>EVK1100 or EVK1101 evaluation kit.
 * </ul>
 *
 * \section setupinfo Setup Information
 * <BR>CPU speed: <i> Internal RC oscillator (about 115200 Hz). </i>
 *
 * \section contactinfo Contact Information
