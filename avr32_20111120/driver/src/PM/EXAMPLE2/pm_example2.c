 * \section intro Introduction
 * This is the documentation for the data structures, functions, variables, defines, enums, and
 * typedefs for the power manager driver. <BR>It also gives an example of the usage of the
 * PM on UC3 products.
 * <BR>This example shows:
 * - how to configure a PLL and switch the main clock to PLL output,
 * - configure a Generic Clock and output it to a GPIO pin,
 * - LED0 blinks endlessly.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC for AVR32 and IAR Systems compiler
 * for AVR32. Other compilers may or may not work.
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * All AVR32 devices with a PM module can be used. This example has been tested
 * with the following setup:<BR>
 * <ul><li>EVK1100 evaluation kit
 * <li>EVK1101 evaluation kit</ul>
 *
 * \section setupinfo Setup Information
 * CPU speed: <i> 48 MHz </i>
 * - On \b EVK1100, check GCLK0 pin with an oscilloscope, the frequency should be 48MHz.
 * On EVK1100, GCLK_0 is pin number 51 (PB19) with AT32UC3A0512 in QFP144 package.
 * Since LED5 is also on PB19, you should also see LED5 turn red.
 * - On \b EVK1101, check GCLK2 pin with an oscilloscope, the frequency should be 48MHz.
 * On EVK1101, GCLK_2 is pin number 30 (PA30) with AT32UC3B0256 in QFP64 package.
 * - Check that LED0 blinks (whatever the board).
