 * \section intro Introduction
 * This is the documentation for the data structures, functions, variables,
 * defines, enums, and typedefs for the interrupt controller driver. It also comes
 * bundled with a basic application as an example of usage.\n
 * This example demonstrates how to use the INTC driver for the USART RXRDY interrupt.
 * <b> Operating mode: </b>each character typed on the PC terminal is echoed back.
 *
 * \note The IAR built-in event handling mechanism manages interrupt groups but not lines.
 * This example shows how to register an interrupt through the INTC driver, which manages lines.
 * If interrupt request lines do not have to be handled separately within groups,
 * then the IAR built-in event handling mechanism can be used in this way:
 * - remove the INTC driver files (intc.c and exception.s82) from the IAR project;
 * - remove calls to the INTC driver functions (\ref INTC_init_interrupts and \ref INTC_register_interrupt);
 * - add <tt>\#pragma handler = \e AVR32_xxxx_IRQ_GROUP, \e int_level</tt> above the \c __interrupt keyword;
 * - the IAR project options can be changed to catch unhandled events under the \e Runtime tab of
 *   the <i>General Options</i> item.
 *
 * \warning The IAR built-in event handling mechanism (<tt>\#pragma exception</tt> and
 *          <tt>\#pragma handler</tt>) MUST NOT be used along with the INTC driver
 *          within a project.
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 * - intc.c: interrupt controller driver;
 * - intc.h: interrupt controller driver header file;
 * - exception.S: exception and interrupt handlers assembly file for GCC;
 * - interrupt_usart_example.c: interrupt controller example application.
 *
 * \section compilinfo Compilation Information
 * This software is written for GNU GCC for AVR32 and for IAR Embedded Workbench
 * for Atmel AVR32. Other compilers may or may not work.
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Information
 * All AVR32 devices with an INTC and a USART module can be used.
 *
 * \section configinfo Configuration Information
 * This example has been tested with the following configuration:
 * - EVK1100 or EVK1101 evaluation kit;
 * - CPU clock: 12 MHz;
 * - USART1 (on EVK1100) or USART0 (on EVK1101) connected to a PC serial port via a standard RS232 DB9 cable;
 * - PC terminal settings:
 *   - 57600 bps,
 *   - 8 data bits,
 *   - no parity bit,
 *   - 1 stop bit,
 *   - no flow control.
