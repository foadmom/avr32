 * \section intro Introduction
 * This is the documentation for the data structures, functions, variables, defines, enums, and
 * typedefs for the TC driver. <BR>It also gives an example of the usage of the
 * TC module.<BR>
 *
 * This example will start a timer/counter and generate a PWM on the output.
 *
 * Channel 0 of timer/counter module 0 is used with the output pin TIOA0.
 * You will find the port and pin number in the datasheet of your device.
 * The selected timer input clock is the internal clock labelled TC2
 * referred to as TIMER_CLOCK2 in the datasheet. Use an oscilloscope to probe the
 * TC channel's output pin.
 * \note
 * - On the AT32UC3A0512, the output pin TIOA0 is mapped on PB23. \n
 * - On the AT32UC3B0256, the output pin TIOA0 is mapped on PB00.
 *
 * The 16-bit timer/counter value register (CV) will cycle from 0x0000 to 0xFFFF.
 * The chosen channel with a low output pin level upon starting point (i.e. when
 * CV == 0) will toggle the output pin level when it reaches the values 0x0600
 * and 0x2000. This will hence produce a PWM output signal with a duty cycle of
 * (0x2000 - 0x600) / 0x10000 i.e. 10.16%
 * \note According to datasheet, TIMER_CLOCK2 is equal to (clk_pba/4). Since we
 * switch the main CPU clock to OSC0 (=12MHz), we have TIMER_CLOCK2 == 3MHz.\n
 * According to the settings performed by the application, the output waveform
 * should thus have the following properties:
 * - The period of the waveform will thus be 3000000/65535 == 45.7Hz,
 * - A full duty cycle(just toggling the channel's output pin when CV reaches
 * 0xFFFF and passes to 0x0000) thus lasts 21.845ms(65535/3000000). A duty cycle
 * of 10.16% means that when probing the channel's output pin you should see a
 * duty cycle of ~2.2ms(10.16% of 21.845ms).
