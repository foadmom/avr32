 * \section intro Introduction
 * This is the documentation for the data structures, functions, variables, defines, enums, and
 * typedefs for the SSC USART emulation driver. <BR>It also comes with an example
 * of the usage of this driver: <BR>
 * - Open an hyperterminal connected to USART 0 (the terminal settings are 57600 8N1).
 * - Type a character : it is echoed back by the application.<BR>
 *
 * \image html ssc_usart_example.jpg
 *
 * \note The IAR built-in event handling mechanism manages interrupt groups but not lines.
 * This example shows how to register an interrupt through the INTC driver, which manages lines.
 * If interrupt request lines do not have to be handled separately within groups,
 * then the IAR built-in event handling mechanism can be used in this way:
 * - remove the INTC driver files (intc.c and exception.s82) from the IAR project;
 * - remove calls to the INTC driver functions (\ref INTC_init_interrupts and \ref INTC_register_interrupt);
 * - add <tt>\#pragma handler = \e AVR32_xxxx_IRQ_GROUP, \e int_level</tt> above the \c __interrupt keyword;
 * - the IAR project options can be changed to catch unhandled events under the \e Runtime tab of
 *   the <i>General Options</i> item.
 *
 * \warning The IAR built-in event handling mechanism (<tt>\#pragma exception</tt> and
 *          <tt>\#pragma handler</tt>) MUST NOT be used along with the INTC driver
 *          within a project.
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 * - ssc_usart.c: SSC driver;
 * - ssc_usart.h: SSC driver header file;
 * - ssc_usart_example.c: SSC example application.
 *
 * \section compilinfo Compilation Information
 * This software is written for GNU GCC for AVR32 and for IAR Embedded Workbench

 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Information
 * All AVR32 devices with a USART module can be used.
 *
 * \section configinfo Configuration Information
 * This example has been tested with the following configuration:
 * - EVK1100 or EVK1101 evaluation kit;
 * - CPU clock: 12 MHz;
 * - USART0 (on EVK1100) or USART1 (on EVK1101) connected to a PC serial port via a standard RS232 DB9 cable;
 * - PC terminal settings:
 *   - 57600 bps,
 *   - 8 data bits,
 *   - no parity bit,
 *   - 1 stop bit,
 *   - no flow control.
