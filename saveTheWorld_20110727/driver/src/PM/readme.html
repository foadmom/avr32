<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Power Manager (PM) controls the oscillators and PLLs, and generates the clocks and
resets in the device. The PM controls two fast crystal oscillators, as well as two PLLs, which can
multiply the clock from either oscillator to provide higher frequencies. Additionally, a low-power
32 KHz oscillator is used to generate the real-time counter clock for high accuracy real-time
measurements. The PM also contains a low-power RC oscillator with fast start-up time, which
can be used to clock the digital logic.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Power Manager Driver</h2>
    <p>The driver is composed of <a href="pm.c">pm.c</a> and <a href="pm.h">pm.h</a>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This driver provides interfaces for PM main hardware features:

       <li>oscillator source setup: external or crystal;
       <li>oscillator startup;
       <li>PLL setup;
       <li>main clock source setup.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>One example is available: <a href="EXAMPLE2/readme.html">EXAMPLE2: how to configure a PLL and switch the main clock to PLL output</a>.</p>
<!-- UC3B_END -->
