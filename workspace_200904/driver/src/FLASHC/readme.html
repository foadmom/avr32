<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The flash controller (FLASHC) interfaces a flash block with the 32-bit internal HSB bus. Performance
for uncached systems with high clock-frequency and one wait state is increased by
placing words with sequential addresses in alternating flash subblocks. Having one read interface
per subblock allows them to be read in parallel. While data from one flash subblock is
being output on the bus, the sequential address is being read from the other flash subblock
and will be ready in the next clock cycle.</p>
    <p>The controller also manages the programming, erasing, locking and unlocking sequences with
dedicated commands.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>FLASHC Driver</h2>
    <p>The driver is composed of <a href="flashc.c">flashc.c</a> and <a href="flashc.h">flashc.h</a>.</p>
    <p>An example is available with the <a href="../../SERVICES/USB/CLASS/DFU/EXAMPLES/ISP/readme.html">USB Bootloader</a>.</p>
