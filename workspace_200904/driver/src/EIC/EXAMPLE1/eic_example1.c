 * \section intro Introduction
 * This is the documentation for the data structures, functions, variables,
 * defines, enums, and typedefs for the EIC driver. This documentation is also
 * bundled with an example.
 *
 * This example shows how to use an external interrupt to wake up the
 * cpu when in sleep mode (static). \n
 * <b>Operating mode:</b>
 * -# At the beginning, CPU is in sleep mode.
 * -# The user needs to press the Joystick(on EVK1100) or PB0(on EVK1101) to
 * leave the sleep mode and the led LED0 toggles. After a short delay, CPU is
 * switched back into sleep mode (back to step 1)...etc
 *
 * \note on EVK1101 Rev. B, PB0 is named PB2.
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 * - eic.c: EIC driver;
 * - eic.h: EIC driver header file;
 * - eic_example1.c: EIC example application.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC for AVR32 and IAR Systems compiler
 * for AVR32. Other compilers may or may not work.
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * All AVR32 devices with a EIC module can be used. This example has been tested
 * with the following setup:<BR>
 * <ul>
 *  <li>EVK1100 evaluation kit
 *  <li>EVK1101 evaluation kit
 *  </ul>
 *
 * \section setupinfo Setup Information
 * CPU speed: <i> Switch to oscillator external OSC0 = 12 Mhz. </i>
